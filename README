# PHP EPEG extension

This PHP extension is using the EPEG library to provide fast JPEG
resize.

If compiled against EPEG-transform fork by @koofr: https://github.com/bohwaz/epeg-transform
it will also provide transformations like flip and rotate.

Forked from https://github.com/rsky/php-epeg

## Compiling with transform support

* Compile and install koofr/epeg
* Run: CFLAGS="-DPHP_EPEG_ENABLE_TRANSFORM=1" ./configure --with-epeg=~/git/koofr/epeg 
* make && sudo make install
* A new method Epeg::transform($transform), see source code for transform constants

BUILDING ON UNIX etc.
=====================

To compile your new extension, you will have to execute the following steps:

1.  $ phpize
2.  $ ./configure [--with-epeg]
3.  $ make
[4. $ make test ] # NOTE: this doesn't work right now *)
5.  $ [sudo] make install

*) this is a general problem with "make test" and standalone extensions
   (that is being worked on) so please don't blame CodeGen_PECL for this
   


BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

The extension provides the VisualStudio V6 project file 

  epeg.dsp
To compile the extension you open this file using VisualStudio,
select the apropriate configuration for your installation
(either "Release_TS" or "Debug_TS") and create "php_epeg.dll"

After successfull compilation you have to copy the newly
created "php_epeg.dll" to the PHP
extension directory (default: C:\PHP\extensions).


TESTING
=======

You can now load the extension using a php.ini directive

  extension="php_epeg.[so|dll]"

or load it at runtime using the dl() function

  dl("php_epeg.[so|dll]");

The extension should now be available, you can test this
using the extension_loaded() function:

  if (extension_loaded(epeg))
    echo "epeg loaded :)";
  else
    echo "something is wrong :(";

The extension will also add its own block to the output
of phpinfo();
